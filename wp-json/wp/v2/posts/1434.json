If you do not receive the email then it may have been blocked by your email provider or in your junk box.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">You also have the option from this window to Request Support, this open up a form you can fill in with your details and request, which goes to our Support team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1439 preserve img-fluid\" src=\"https:\/\/www.salesian.vic.edu.au\/app\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog-PAM-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\"><\/p><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Once you are in PAM, the first thing you should do is go to <strong>Menu \u2013 My Settings<\/strong> and check what email we have associated with your account<\/span><\/p>\n<p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1438 preserve img-fluid\" src=\"https:\/\/www.salesian.vic.edu.au\/app\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog-PAM-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"53\" height=\"55\"><\/p><\/p>\n<p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1437 preserve img-fluid\" src=\"https:\/\/www.salesian.vic.edu.au\/app\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog-PAM-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\"><\/p><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Here you can change your email address for PAM (or add an email address if there is not one there) and change your password. This is an important step as it means that if you ever lose or forget your password you can use the email feature to reset your password. Changing your default password is also a good idea as it means you are more likely to remember it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><strong>Note:<\/strong> The email you change here does not change the email the school has on file for other communications.

This will send you a verification email, which you need to go to your email inbox to click the link to verify. If you do not receive the email, you should check the email in the <strong>MySettings page<\/strong> (as shown above) to ensure the address is correct. If it is correct then the most likely explanation is it has been filtered out or put in the junk mail folder in your email (you may need to check this). If you have an alternate email address, you can change it to this and try again to see if it works with a different email.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">After you have logged in please review the bell symbol, and if there is a red number next to it, click on it and attend to any alerts that need your attention (e.g. Medical Profile)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1436 preserve img-fluid\" src=\"https:\/\/www.salesian.vic.edu.au\/app\/uploads\/2018\/03\/blog-PAM-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"55\"><\/p><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Note: This system will be used for excursion permissions.
