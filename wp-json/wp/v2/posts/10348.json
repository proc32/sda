In a Catholic school that hope is based on the experience of God\u2019s<\/p>\n<p>love and care for all. It is my hope that from Wednesday 3 November our students will enjoy re-establishing relationships in the classroom with his teachers and peers.

Whether we\u2019re teaching remotely or face-to-face, our focus for Term 4 is on making sure that every student is supported in their wellbeing, learning and transition needs.<\/p>\n<p>Given the circumstances presented due to COVID-19, the College has made adjustments to ensure the College maximises face-to-face learning for our students.

We must now look to the coming weeks and prepare ourselves for what is going to be a very different and challenging time. It is a very difficult time for all concerned. Nothing would make all of us happier than to be returning to some form of normality, but unfortunately this can\u2019t happen and we must make the most of what we have.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday the Victorian Government announced that on the advice of the Victorian Chief Health Officer, metropolitan Melbourne will move to Stage 4 restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

It is very important to note that the Victorian Chief Health Officer has advised that schools can continue to operate. Salesian College will take direction from the appropriate government areas and from Catholic Education Melbourne. We will ensure that we do everything in our power to keep our community safe.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of these changed arrangements is to reduce the number of students and families moving across metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).<\/p>\n<p>It is, however, important that face-to-face teaching be maintained for some students. This includes students in Years 11 and 12 (and Year 10 students who have VCE studies or VCAL strands in their learning program) because of the importance of enabling all students to continue or complete their senior secondary certificate, either VCE or VCAL.<\/p>\n<p>Staff will be working to prepare for the next phase of flexible and remote learning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What this means for your son, and what we are asking you to do:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday 14 July \u2013 Friday 17 July<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Years 11 and 12<\/strong> <strong>and<\/strong> <strong>Year 10 boys undertaking VCE or VCAL studies<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Return for face-to-face learning.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Year 10 boys<\/strong> are required to attend for their Unit 2 classes only.

Supplying your son with a personal supply of hand sanitizer is recommended.<\/li>\n<li>If your son becomes unwell whist at school, he will be isolated. You will be contacted immediately and asked to come to the College to pick him up as soon as possible.<\/li>\n<li>If your child is ill or is feeling unwell, they must not attend school. They must remain home and seek medical advice.<\/li>\n<li>Public Transport: We encourage you to consider alternative arrangements for public transport.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Exams<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Year 11 Exams will be run at school under normal exam conditions.<\/li>\n<li>Arrangements for other year levels will remain as planned for remote learning.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Other important considerations to note:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>No student supervision will be available at the College on our student free day on Monday May 25.<\/li>\n<li>Charter buses will be back as normal from Tuesday 26 May.<\/li>\n<li>Boys will be required to return to the College in full school uniform and in strict compliance with the College Uniform Code in relation to appearance, facial hair and hair style.<\/li>\n<li>As we have been directed to cancel all sport there will be no sport afternoons, and therefore there will be no need for the boys to wear their sport uniforms to school.<\/li>\n<li>Supervised private study will replace sport afternoons.<\/li>\n<li>Boys will still be expected to bring their sports uniforms in for participation in PE classes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Important Information from Academy Uniforms:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>\u201cGiven that most students have yet to purchase their winter uniforms, we are concerned about the volume of families that will be visiting our store closer to the return to school date and the implications that this will have regarding the social distancing.

Included in this change has been how we assess and report on student learning.<\/p>\n<p>The Semester 1 report will look slightly different from usual. Following the advice of the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA), Victorian Department of Education and Training, and the Catholic Education Commission of Victoria Ltd (CECV), this report will provide:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A description of the areas of the Victorian Curriculum F\u201310 taught in Semester 1.<\/li>\n<li>A succinct assessment of student learning achievement, based on the Achievement Standards in the Victorian Curriculum F\u201310 and, where possible, progress.<\/li>\n<li>An additional comment providing an indication on how your child has adjusted to the remote and flexible learning environment, with reference to the \u2018Personal and Social Capability\u2019 curriculum.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We thank you for your understanding of the addition to the Semester 1 reports, as impacted by the change in learning environments this term, and of the approach to continuity of learning that our school has taken.<\/p>\n<p>Please note Semester 1 reports will be released to parents and guardians on Friday 26 June.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Routine <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We strongly encourage all boys to take this time to get back into a regular \u2018school day\u2019 routine. This may include setting their alarm earlier, organising their school bag and resources in advance, and getting enough sleep the night before school. Families are also encouraged to consider transport options to and from the College, and explore alternatives other than public transport where possible.<\/p>\n<p>There will be no change to the start and end of the College day. We expect to see an increase in boys being transported to and from school. If you are contemplating this, please consider dropping off and picking up your sons in the surrounding streets, rather than on the College grounds, or dropping them off earlier in the morning.<\/p>\n<p>If public transport is the only option, then boys should plan their journeys now to ensure that they are at the College on time and ready to learn. The College expectations on punctuality and attendance will be in full effect from the first day back from remote learning.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Contact Details<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is important that the College has up to date and accurate records to allow effective and efficient communication.<\/p>\n<p>Please log in to your PAM account and ensure that your details are verified.

Students coming into school will access the remote learning provided by their teachers whilst under the supervision of support staff.<\/p>\n<p>Normal services provided for the boys i.e. canteen, charter buses or the like will not run.<\/p>\n<p>We recognise that Year 12 students will have specific questions. These Year 12 details will be communicated in the coming days.<\/p>\n<p>I wish to remind all our students that they are not alone in this journey and that when we are able to adjust and adapt quickly, we will notice the greatest success.<\/p>\n<p>We ask God to bless our College community and keep us all safe and healthy over the coming Easter break. We pray that we can soon return to normal College life and resume our mission of educating and nurturing students here at the College.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rob Brennan<\/strong><br>\nPrincipal<\/p>\n<p><strong>COVID-19 Update \u2013 Monday 6 April 2020<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Summary:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The College currently has two plans for the beginning Term 2:<br>\n<strong>Plan A:<\/strong> For a full return, as normal (unlikely), and<br>\n<strong>Plan B:<\/strong> For initiating our Remote Learning Plan<\/li>\n<li>Once the Government and Catholic Education Melbourne confirms further details, the College will communicate next week\u2019s plan.<\/li>\n<li>In the likely case that we are required to deliver remote learning, the College will also provide supervision at school for those students unable to remain at home.

It is likely that the College will be required to deliver remote learning, as well as provide supervision for students unable to remain at home. In this case, the College is unable to deliver classes both online and at school. Given that teachers will be required to deliver their curriculum remotely from home, students at school will be supervised by College Support Staff. We ask families who are likely to send their sons to school for supervision, to contact us so that we can make appropriate arrangements (qualification criteria applies).
